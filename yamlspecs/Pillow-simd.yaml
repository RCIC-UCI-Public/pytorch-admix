  description: |
    Pillow-SIMD is following Pillow. Pillow-SIMD versions are 100% compatible drop-in 
    replacements for Pillow of the same version. SIMD stands for single instuction, 
    multiple data and its essence is in performing the same operation on multiple 
    data points simultaneously by using multiple processing elements. 
    Currently, Pillow-SIMD can be compiled with SSE4 (default) or AVX2 support.
