    Pillow-SIMD version {{version}}, a highly optimized version of Pillow library
    for x86 architecture (mainly Intel and AMD CPUs). Pillow-SIMD is 100% compatible
    drop-in replacement for Pillow of the same version. SIMD stands for single instuction,
    multiple data and its essence is in performing the same operation on multiple data
    points simultaneously by using multiple processing elements.
