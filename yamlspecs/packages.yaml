# This packages.yaml is a bit odd. The standard bootstrap and manifest will generate
# the non-cuda versions. Pytorch cuda and pytorch conflict with each other, 
# but both can be built  on a non-gpu host.
# the default manifest is for a non-cuda node
# the default build will build everything
#
# See ../README.md about how to set libcudnn
